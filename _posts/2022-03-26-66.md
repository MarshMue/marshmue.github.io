Had some big time nostalgia driving down a road I hadn't since high school as I was on my way to a friend's house. I'm evermore reminded of how right Proust was in describing this and I wonder how widely understood this phenomena is. We know that our brains are remarkable at associating things, but do we know why? Might be interesting to look into some research on this. It's interesting reading *The Extended Mind* as it does describe some of this work. How our spaces and physical actions can influence how well we think and learn.

Busy day so I'll leave the reading section as my main thoughts of the day!

**Daily Listening**

Some [songs](https://open.spotify.com/track/5A9ctUIDmzvkhFswdZuEuL?si=e27e472478b0418f) that a friend shared with me along with [The Planets by Holst](https://open.spotify.com/album/4v0Xyz0LVToUsSTGdsvKSK?si=iBfPCINfQcy8pmMLsZuzBg). 

**Daily Reading**

Read a bunch of *The Extended Mind* while on flight back to Boston. I think it has enough in it to justify owning a copy, and mainly for the references therein and the contextualization of them. I actually don't find the book super rigorous or convincing in certain matters, but I still like its presentation and the potential of the ideas. It has so many references that I'd like to check out and I think there's a lot of value still in a work that compiles them like this and provides a high level overview (even if infactual!) of how they interconnect. There is a lot that does resonate well with other intuitions I've had so I think there is a lot of merit to these ideas of how we get value from physical spaces and our extended environment in our tools and people we interact with.

Drove out to western MA for a day trip to visit some of my friend's old haunts. The first stop was a [quaint used bookstore](https://goo.gl/maps/d9vNV771hAH5Urd58). It's located in an old mill alongside a fast flowing river that was fun to watch while we enjoyed a little snack after perusing the bookstore. I actually found a copy of [a collection of stories/essays](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2081.The_Mind_s_I) curated by Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter that I had wanted to read, and also [a Thoreau book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27207977-the-maine-woods) that I have heard good things about. 

Afterwards, we went to [Puffer's Pond](https://goo.gl/maps/BiMKCXs4YcsTLVhc9) and hung out in a hammock to enjoy the peaceful quiet of being away from the city as well as the warm weather. Meant to do some reading, but we instead took a nap and chatted. 

We went into Northampton for dinner. I was surprised at how much bigger Northampton was than I had expected it to be. I had visited UMass Amherst as a prospective grad school and really enjoyed the area, but I must have only visited Amherst which I had recalled to be pretty small and charming. We got ice cream afterwards and walked around a bit before heading back to Somerville. 

It was real nice to get away from the city for a day and have some peace and quiet. Hopefully going to be doing more of this over the summer.

**Daily Listening**

[This album](https://open.spotify.com/album/6IIeUGxCqrugMgzKxjivaF?si=nyxUqN9cTcag1jhYOa6Siw) has been some pleasant background listening.

**Daily Reading**

No reading, but that's a little more understandable given the traveling.

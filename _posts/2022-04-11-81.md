For the first time in a long while I was in bed when I was supposed to in order to get up at 7am as I want to! I had been doing a lot of ruminating yesterday about my systems/processes as a was feeling demotivated at work and chose to pursue why I was feeling that way. I think it is because I haven't had a good system for myself that makes knowing what I should be working on a frictionless activity. Perhaps pursing more of a *[Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)* approach could be helpful, but I recall having found translating my work to that format to be a bit difficult. I probably just didn't try hard enough or commit enough to it to make it work before - or I just need to adapt it to the type of work that I have. Anyways I spend too much effort trying to figure out how I should be spending my time and it would be better to have actions I need to be doing identified and structured in such a way that it is obvious what to do and obvious to me while working on them that that is what I should be doing.

**Daily Listening**

This classic [Men I Trust song + video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnY7m5CK-as). Does anyone capture the melancholy of our age better than them? [Another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmVeQEysvtk) for good measure... and why not [one more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCDQN8iDCzo)!

**Daily Reading**

More *The Rings of Saturn* - it's a short book so I'll probably finish it this weekend.

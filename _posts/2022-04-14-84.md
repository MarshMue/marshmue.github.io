Stir fry technique needs to be improved when tossing a dish with a sauce; I managed to hit myself a bit and thankfully not burn myself. The seasoning of the wok has definitely had its effect at making it nonstick! I fried this eggplant dish I've done two times now and the first time I did it on my wok the eggplants stuck to it while frying, but now they all moved freely. It's great fun to stir fry things and I'm so far very happy with getting the wok! 

It's a strange week as a few friends of mine in the program are getting their PhDs. It's bittersweet because I'm happy for them, but sad because this signals that they won't be here next year. It's also strange because it signals such a transition will be coming for me as well soon. Reminds me, in a way, of Sebald's writings about Dunwich. How things can seem static, but are changing over time. This makes me muse about the different scales that this occurs on - plate tectonics being one essentially incomprehensible to us and stellar evolution even more incomprehensible. But somethings change so quickly that the change is more normal to us. Melting ice for example, or a meal right before consumption. We're used to change in some context, and perhaps our comfort with it is related to how quickly the change occurs for any given thing? We cannot delay our hunger so we must be at ease with consuming new meals each day, but we can't do much about the decay of our land or the sun, so we just have to forget about it and pretend it isn't happening (which we can do because it won't affect us in our lifetimes. Any given generation of people will not have to worry about it in the future until some point where things start to decay in ways that we probably cannot understand now. Hard to think about and maybe better to not think about?).

**Daily Listening**

These two tracks ([one](https://open.spotify.com/track/4DDeOfgeO86ntXLV9MXRTG?si=bc0fa5fbe8584244) [two](https://open.spotify.com/track/1jevyUVT06z5xi8MjFmO64?si=e8e1d2ea15a04c20)) in particular have stood out too me from an algorithmic recommended EP. 

**Daily Reading**

Some more of *The Rings of Saturn*. Learned about an incredible palace that Kublai Khan had constructed where Beijing is in the present - apparently the best judged quality evergreen trees where imported wholly from many miles away to make the palace. It's too bad we don't have any real way of seeing how it actually was. Also had [this poem](https://victorianweb.org/authors/swinburne/northsea.html) recommended as a meditation on the natural dissolution of life with Dunwich as a metaphor.

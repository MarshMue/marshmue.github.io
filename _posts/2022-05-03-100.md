Made a nice wok dinner for some friends last night. A side dish of small potatoes that I think could have been seasoned a little bit more as well as a variation on this eggplant dish that I've made a few times now. I think I nailed the sauce in the eggplant dish as it tasted absolutely incredible, and the potatoes made for a good side. It's nice to be getting more and more accustomed to the wok and feeling good about what I am making (making food that tastes good is a great function to optimize ðŸ˜‹).

Met up with a friend who I met virtually over the pandemic via a mutual friend for the first time as he was in Boston for a conference in western MA. We walked all over Somerville and Cambridge visiting the Zuck's favorite pizza place in Harvard square as well as going to the great ice cream place Toscanini's. Always nice to walk around and have great conversation with someone, although I am quite sore from having worn bad sandals!

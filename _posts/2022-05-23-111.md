I realized I haven't been doing my weekly task tracking for a few weeks now. I partially got caught up in end of semester business and travels, but also started filling out my task sheet without much thought, which I think was defeating the purpose of it. I want to iterate on it in some way for this summer to ensure that I make progress towards the things that I want to be; namely figuring out where to apply for internships, my dissertation, and some side hobby whether computer science related or not. I'd like to be doing something artful like making music or drawing. Perhaps both! So, point being that I need to work on a system to help keep myself accountable to doing these things and not making them feel like chores.

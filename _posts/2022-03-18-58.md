Traveled home to MN for Spring Break. A bit unfortunate as the Boston weather was *literally* in the 70s (F) and MN is going to be about 20-30 degrees colder. Worthwhile to see family though!

**Daily Listening**

Sweet Trip dropped an [incredible collection of unreleased tracks](https://open.spotify.com/album/3RvSjQvdTlQPsp32EaGwzp?si=kR-iXMi_SEyzQkeUvjLaFQ).

**Daily Reading**

Finished the David Foster Wallace essay *A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again*. He does a great job of expressing the weird feelings around tourism and service industry jobs - I could relate after some activities I had done recently in Hawai'i. I liked it overall. 

Read another chapter of *The Mysterious Island*. Not much left to resolve.

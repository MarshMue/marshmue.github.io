Still feeling like I am busy all the time, but not spending time on the things that I would like to be doing. I think I need to remedy this by making a physical board that I see and interact with each day. The daily task tracking journal method is great for making sure I do certain things everyday and holding me accountable to that, but it inherently fails for things that I don't intend to do every day, but still want to do. So perhaps I need one that operates at a weekly scale to ensure I make progress on these non-daily activities? I'll try it.

**Daily Listening**

Besides playing one part from *Daphnis et Chloe* I just kept listening to [this album](https://open.spotify.com/album/1ERrUvG31thFCxdwWUoJrY?si=PvEFvBQeTXqW865TiJmMTg). It's like candy to my brain fo some reason so I'm just embracing that. Still can't get over how good the transition from *Dawning of the Season* to *Secrets (Your Fire)* is.

They also have sick videos. [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlhIk7iPU9o) is just goofy and fun, and [this other one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXLCHvRsgRQ) makes really really cool use of GANs. MAkes me want to try my hand at some neural art. 

**Daily Reading**

Once again no reading for social reasons ðŸ˜¬

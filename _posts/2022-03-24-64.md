Nice to spend some time at our cabin even in winter.

**Daily Listening**

There's a new Sound of Ceres album coming out and this [orchestral piece](https://open.spotify.com/album/0XZnh9WGpXa3sCMABv7xas?si=w3vkX1TsR9SsmGiokNfQzw) is one of the inspirations for the album - I quite liked it.

**Daily Reading**

I did a whole flurry of reading today - A chapter of *The Mysterious Island*, 2 chapters of *The Extended Mind*, and about 25 pages of *Infinite Jest*, which I finally started as I'm reading it with a friend. 

I wish the author of the Extended Mind was more skeptical about some of the results and I feel like theres a lot of discussion (currently) missing on the causal connections between some of the studies and the interpretations - like if you claim that walking is helping you make better decisions, how do you rule out all other possible factors?

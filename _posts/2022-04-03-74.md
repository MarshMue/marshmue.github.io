Pretty busy day between sleeping in, talking with some friends, going to the gym, and then preparing for a presentation I have this week. It was a pretty busy weekend, but I'll be able to make up for that with a more relaxed one next weekend. Plus I have a reward in seeing (knock on wood) Spirit of the Beehive on Tuesday night. I need to make sure that I get back into reading daily as that is a habit too valuable to ignore.

**Daily Listening**

An old [Stereolab track](https://open.spotify.com/track/1M9eLwij1pqsX4DNjnW5y5?si=a5fa9e14a3da411a) that vibes well with me.

**Daily Reading**

3 days in a row without reading ðŸ˜¬ I have been exceptionally busy, but that is not really an excuse.

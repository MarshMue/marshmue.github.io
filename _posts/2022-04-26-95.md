Bit busy today so I'll leave my thoughts with what is below.

**Daily Listening**

I think I shared [this](https://open.spotify.com/track/1DanZnatmyzIs9ROMmTsU8?si=1ad1afc5cb114a1f) a few days ago, but I'm pretty settled this is my favorite version of this particular song from the ballet. I think it's really the harp that does it for me. It feels muddy on other versions, but here it is magnificent.

**Daily Reading**

Three days without reading! I think I actually need to wake up earlier to be able to ensure I get some reading done in the morning. Maybe I'll just axe wordle from my daily routine since I'm not sure how much enjoyment I'm getting from it or whether it is just a chore at this point. Worldle and Globle continue to be joys though!

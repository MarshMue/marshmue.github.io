I set a daily goal to do some thinking/writing physically and I think it was helpful for me during my workday. It feels a little alien to me as I don't do this regularly, but I feel armed with the knowledge now that it really does help your thinking so that I see genuine merit to understanding how to do it better. Plus it creates a physical record of your accomplishments and thoughts as you try to understand things better. Plus it helps you build drawing skills for complicated ideas which is generically useful.

**Daily Listening**

I spent much of the day working with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKFTSSKCzWA) on in the background. Not music, but definitely conducive to thinking and writing.

**Daily Reading**

Started reading more of W. G. Sebald's *The Rings of Saturn* before bed. It's a collections of meditations of his while walking along the english coast which are great to read before bed.

Watched men's curling with a friend and it was hilarious to hear their comments during the match. They're from MN/WI so they all have familiar accents and manners of speech that are enjoyable to hear and make me miss being immersed in it back in MN. I feel like I should be watching more of the Olypmics since it is a fun spectacle that happens so seldomly + I think watching people compete at high levels can be pretty motivating as well.

**Daily Listening**

Revisited an "old" [favorite album of mine](https://open.spotify.com/album/4n9J61IrlrEFswxTu0MJIo?si=Cm3viaS7Spy48OUiMoY2Bg).

**Daily Reading**

Only read a chapter of *The Mysterious Island* and it's reminding me why I've enjoyed reading Jules Verne - fun and proactive characters dealing with their problems!

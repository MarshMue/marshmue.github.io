I've been trialing writing these entries in the morning of the day after instead of at night since I would always run out of time in the evenings and I didn't like losing out on sleep. However I'm noticing just how much of the day I don't remember after a night of sleep. In particular I don't remember a lot of the things I thought about which are usually what I like to write about. So, I think it is very worthwhile to do that brain dump at night so that I don't lose those thoughts!

**Daily Listening**

I didn't really like the Yasuke anime, but the soundtrack is [pretty good](https://open.spotify.com/track/4y8EILMb6SpBnaZ5KGpbdo?si=d2f552533f474fbf).

**Daily Reading**

I'm managing about a chapter of *The Mysterious Island* each night before melatonin knocks me out, which is nice but I would like to be reading more!

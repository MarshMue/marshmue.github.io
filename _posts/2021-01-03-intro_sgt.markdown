Let $$G = \{V, E, W\}$$ be a graph with weighted edges.

For any graph we can define associated matrices:
 * The degree matrix $$D$$ where $$D_{ii} = deg(i)$$
 * The adjacency matrix $$A$$ where $$A_{ij} = W(i,j)$$

$$D = \begin{pmatrix}2  & 0&0 &0 &0 &0\\
    0  & 3&0 &0 &0 &0\\
    0  & 0&2 &0 &0 &0\\
    0  & 0&0 &3 &0 &0\\
    0  & 0&0 &0 &3 &0\\
    0  & 0&0 &0 &0 &1\\\end{pmatrix},\ A = \begin{pmatrix}0  & 1&0 &0 &1 &0\\
    1  & 0&1 &0 &1 &0\\
    0  & 1&0 &1 &0 &0\\
    0  & 0&1 &0 &1 &1\\
    1  & 1&0 &1 &0 &0\\
    0  & 0&0 &1 &0 &0\\\end{pmatrix}$$


From these matrices we can define the Graph Laplacian as $$L= D-A$$    

$$L = \begin{pmatrix}2  & -1&0 &0 &-1 &0\\
    -1  & 3&-1 &0 &-1 &0\\
    0  & -1&2 &-1 &0 &0\\
    0  & 0&-1 &3 &-1 &-1\\
    -1  & -1&0 &-1 &3 &0\\
    0  & 0&0 &-1 &0 &1\\\end{pmatrix}$$

Can we learn about the graph from the laplacian?

Consider $$L$$ as a linear transformation. Looking at the $$i^{th}$$ component of the resultant vector:
$$(Lx)_i = \sum_{i,j} w_{ij} (x_i - x_j)$$ 

If $$u$$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $$\lambda$$ then 

$$(Lu)_i = \sum_{i,j} w_{ij} (u_i - u_j) = \lambda u_i $$
How to interpret? 

 * Smaller eigenvalues mean that $$u_i \approx u_j$$, with more similarity for larger $$w_{ij}$$. For example the smallest eigenvalue is 0 when $$u_i=u_j$$ for all $$i,j$$ (the constant vector)
 * For large eigenvalues $$u$$ will be such that $$u_i$$ and $$u_j$$ are opposite in sign to maximize the difference. 

So what does this mean?
 * The eigenvectors between the constant vector and the oscillating one are a mixture. 
 * Oscillations start to happen between larger components of the graph and then get smaller until it oscillates practically every other vertex 
 * This gives us a method to find similar structures in the graph

# Image and Sound[^1][^2]

[^1]: An online WIP textbook detailing the representation of image and sound from the earliest recordings to today. I expect to bias towards the image component initially as I know more about that and feel more motivated to. Draft chapters will be hyperlinks, and otherwise exist to serve as landmarks for me and what I intend to cover.
[^2]: No promises on ever finishing it ðŸ˜‰.

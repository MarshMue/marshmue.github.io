I'm interested in collecting examples of organizations that have gone beyond what is ordinary to achieve or create something unique. In particular organizations that seem to be playing a different game than everyone else in the sense that they have no true competition.

- The [Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One#Mercedes-AMG_Petronas_Formula_One_Team_(2010â€“present)>) has had the longest winning streak in F1 history so far. Winning the Constructor's Championship 8 times consecutively from 2014 to 2021 (For the drivers: [Nico Rosberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg) obtained 1 in 2016, while [Lewis Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton) achieved 7 - Lewis could be a bullet point too, but he's not an organization).

- [Xerox PARC](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)#History>) brought on many of the big names from the ARPA/IPTO community to develop much of what is now recognizable as modern computing today. (Although some like Alan Kay would suggest that what we have today is like riding a bicycle with training wheels)

I am know that there are many more examples hidden out of plain sight, so please [let me know](mailto:marshall.mueller@tufts.edu) if you have any suggestions!

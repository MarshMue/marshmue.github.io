I am Math PhD looking for research opportunities in mechanistic interpretability of neural networks. 

I received my PhD from Tufts University advised by [James M. Murphy](https://jmurphy.math.tufts.edu/) and [Abiy Tasissa](https://abiy-tasissa.github.io/index.html). My dissertation is entitled *Local Sparse Representations: Connections With the Delaunay Triangulation and Dictionary Learning in Wasserstein Space*. Before that I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a double major in math and computer sciences; I was fortunate to have advising from [Sigurd Angenent](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~angenent/) and [Dave Anderson](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~dfanderson/).

### Miscellanea

I am shifting my book shelves away from goodreads. So far I just have books I have read, but I've highlighted my favorites and some I think are must reads. Hopefully I will add some reviews and longer form commentary in the future. 

Website design inspired by the delightfully simple aesthetic of [Shoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoji).

With my Math PhD recently finished, I am looking for research opportunities in interpretability of AI systems. In particular, I am looking to understand AI [mechanistically](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) with the goal of uncovering the algorithms learned by models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. 

At Tufts University I was advised by [James M. Murphy](https://jmurphy.math.tufts.edu/) and [Abiy Tasissa](https://abiy-tasissa.github.io/index.html). My dissertation is entitled *Local Sparse Representations: Connections With the Delaunay Triangulation and Dictionary Learning in Wasserstein Space*. 

I like to [read](bookshelf), [write](writing), take [photos](photography), watch [movies](https://letterboxd.com/mashygpig/), and practice Kyudo. 

In the past I attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a double major in math and computer sciences (yes science**s**). I was fortunate to have advising from [Sigurd Angenent](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~angenent/) and [Dave Anderson](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~dfanderson/).

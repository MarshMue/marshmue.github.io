I like to [read](bookshelf), [write](writing), take [photos](photography), watch [movies](https://letterboxd.com/mashygpig/), and practice Kyudo. 

Taking english classes were some of my favorite experiences during my PhD. I organize a [film club](/filmclub) for my friends to provide a space for similar levels of discussion around movies.  

For the first few months of 2022 I journaled publicly; find it archived it [here](/posts).

I am a Math PhD student at Tufts University right outside of Boston. My research interests are largely centered around topics in applied mathematics; mainly centered around signal and image processing

I also enjoy learning about what makes great organizations so effective and how we can build them; I find myself drawn more to Industrial Engineering and Operations Research as time goes on and am looking for opportunities to get some hands on experience in the field (want to hire me? [let me know](mailto:marshall.mueller@tufts.edu))

Some hobbies of mine: walking, reading, writing, biking, hiking, sailing, Neapolitan pizza

I am a Math PhD student at Tufts University right outside of Boston. My research interests are (in no particular order): anomaly detection, graph theory, algorithms, signal and image processing, and many more

I also enjoy learning about what makes great organizations so effective and how to build them

Some hobbies of mine: reading, writing, sailing, biking, hiking, Neapolitan pizza
